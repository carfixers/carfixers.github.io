**Q. I am going out of the city for 25-30 days. During this period, my car is not going to be used by anyone else. What precautionary steps should I take for ensuring no damage occurs to the car by lying in an idle state for so long?**

One needs to take care of 2-3 things when the car is to be left idle for many days.

First and foremost – avoid battery drainage

The battery continues to drain even when the car is not in use. To avoid this, you must remove the battery and store it away safely.  While removing the battery, start with the negative terminal first and then move on to the positive terminal. Take utmost precaution that both the terminals do not come in contact with each other. Apply petroleum jelly or grease on the battery terminals and wire ends to prevent rusting.<figure id="attachment_50" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Secondly – tyre maintenance

Make sure that the tyres are filled with little more amount of air pressure. This way, even though the tyre pressure will reduce daily by very small amount even if the car is idle, when u come back you will not find tyres completely flat.<figure id="attachment_51" style="width: 430px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">
